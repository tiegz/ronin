Ronin
=====

This is a quickly spun together plugin to measure the basic system memory of a Rails request 
from start to finish. 

Instructions:

1) Set the Environment variable "RONIN" to "on" (on command-line, in config/environment.rb, etc.) 
2) Ronin will automatically fire up and wrap your requests with a little helpful logging. The output
is in a Ruby-style Hash:

{ :growth => [PERCENTAGE OF CHANGE], :request_time => [TIME FOR REQUEST AS RECORDED BY RONIN], :min_rss => [LOWEST RSS SIZE], :max_rss => [HIGHEST RSS SIZE], :delta_rss => [SPAN OF RSS CHANGE], :uri => [URI PATH REQUESTED] }

...so if you ever need to analyze the data collectively instead of just
eyeing it, it's as easy as running irb or script/console and doing something like this:

requests = open('log/ronin.log').read.split("\n").map { |line| eval line }


Example
=======

Start up server: 
  "RONIN=on script/server"

Include in config/environments/*.rb: 
  "ENV['RONIN'] = 'on'"

And curl a request:

curl -i http://my.application.and.stuff:3000/things.xml
#=> { :growth => 0.01, :request_time => 2.300322, :min_rss => 34188, :max_rss => 34488, :delta_rss => 300, :uri => '/things.xml' }
